    <p>
On a Wednesday night in 1995, a future icon was born. Hi, Iâ€™m Kaymel I am said icon I was born in the small southern town of Jacksonville NC. Through the years I have grown into a wonderful person I joined the NC Army National Guard at age 17 while in the military I gained irreplaceable leadership, attention to detail, and teamwork is key. I am currently attending Make School a computer science institution of higher learning where at the end of this crazy journey I will be ready to be a         full-stack engineer focused on the front end and product development.
